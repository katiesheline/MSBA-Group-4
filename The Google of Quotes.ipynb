    "# The Google of Quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The file “quotes.txt” contains pairs of lines, with the first line being a quote and the following line being the person who said it. We want to build a search engine that, given a word or words, finds the best matching quotes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Build a list of full quotes (5 points). Read in the file, and create a list of full quotes of the form “quote - speaker”. For example, “The heart has its reasons, of which the mind knows nothing. - Blaise Pascal”.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Words from full quotes (5 points). Write a function that takes a full quote as argument and outputs a list of the words in the list. The words should all be lower-case, and should contain only characters, digits, or underscore. Hint: Use the lower() function of strings, and re.split() to split into words, but you must figure out the regular expression for re.split().\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Build the postings-list dictionary (6 points). A postings-list is a dictionary whose keys are full quotes, and whose values are themselves dictionaries with key being a word, and value being the number of times the word occurs in the full quote. So, for the key “The heart has its reasons, of which the mind knows nothing. - Blaise Pascal”, the value will itself be the following dictionary: {’the’:2, ’heart’:1, ’has’:1, ’its’:1, ’reasons’:1, ’of’:1, ’which’:1, ’mind’:1, ’knows’:1, ’nothing’:1, ’blaise’:1, ’pascal’:1}.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Build the reverse postings-list dictionary (6 points). A reverse postings-list is a dictionary whose keys are the words, and the values are themselves dictionaries with the key being a full quote, and the value being the number of times the word appeared in the full quote. So, for the key “entertainer”, the value is the dictionary {’An actor is at most a poet and at least an entertainer. - Marlon Brando’: 1} (only this quote contains the word “entertainer”).  \n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Write a TF-IDF function (8 points). To measure how much a full quote is about a particular word, one typically uses the TF-IDF measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  • TF stands for “term frequency”; the term frequency of a word w in a full quote q is the number of times w occurs in q, divided by the maximum number of times any word occurs in q.  \n",
    "  • IDF stands for “inverse document frequency”: the IDF of a word w is the logarithm of the ratio of the total number N of full quotes to the number of full quotes in that contain the word w.  \n",
    "  • TF-IDF of a word w for a full quote q is just the product of the TF and IDF.  \n",
    "So, for the word “entertainer” in the Marlon Brando quote of part (d):  \n",
    "  • The TF is 0.5 (it occurs once, while the most frequent word in that quote is “at”, which occurs twice, so the TF ratio is 0.5)  \n",
    "  • The IDF is log (895/1), since there are 895 documents and the word “entertainer ” occurs in only one full quote. Write a function to compute the TF-IDF of any word in any full quote, using the postings and reverse-postings. Hint: Do import math and use math.log() to get logarithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Quote search using a single word (5 points). Write a function that takes a word as argument, and returns a dictionary whose keys are full quotes containing that word, and whose values are the TF-IDF score of that word for that full quote.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Quote search using multiple words (5 points). Write a function that takes a list of words as argument, and returns a dictionary whose keys are full quotes containing that word, and whose values are the sum of TF-IDF scores of all the words for that full quote."

To combine these lists, the join function was utilized, taking the an item from the quote list and pairing it with the appropriate item from the author list.

After this, each word in that list was read and compared to see if it was in a dummy dictionary (word_list - initialized as blank). If the word did not exist in the dummy dictionary it was added with value being 1. If the word did exist, the value was incremented by 1.
